# The XMPP server
I found this: https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/

## Openfire 4.4.4
Openfire is a real time collaboration (RTC) server licensed under the
Open Source Apache License. It uses the only widely adopted open
protocol for instant messaging, XMPP (also called Jabber). Openfire is
incredibly easy to setup and administer, but offers rock-solid
security and performance.

I have Mac, so I downloaded openfire_4_4_4.dmg.
